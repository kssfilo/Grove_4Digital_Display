4 digit display module is usually a 12 pin module. In this Grove gadget, we utilize a TM1637 to scale down the controlling pins into 2 Grove pins. It only takes 2 digital pins of Arduino or Seeeduino to control the content, even the luminance of this display. For projects that require of alpha-numeric display, this can be a nice choice.

### Usage:

1. Clone this repo or download as a zip;
2. Unzip the zip file if you downloaded a zip file;
3. Copy the directory "DigitalTube" and "TimerOne" into Arduino's libraries directory;
4. Open Arduino IDE, go to "File"->"Examples"->"DigitalTube"

Assume that you connected the grove correctly.
